# Notes — WP-0.4

## Decisions applied
- D-20 (Open): this WP produces the evidence that closes it. ADR-005 tie rule: LiveKit Cloud. Status changes to ADR-005/D-20 only after the owner's explicit approval of the recommendation.
- D-16 (Default): recording copied to private EU storage within 1 h and deleted from the provider within 24 h. Spike proves the mechanics with local MinIO standing in for S3 `eu-central-1`.

## Owner approvals
- 2026-10-12, design and tasks approved via the approval page (https://claude.ai/artifact/TPZyiDjkotwuBEUXn66Xmv). Answers: 1 yes · 2 (a) has a Mac usable for a week, **not available yet** · 3 devices: Android phone, iPhone, iPad (plus the Windows PC with Chrome) · 4 three adult helpers available · 5 tools outside the repo approved (`cloudflared`, JDK + Android SDK in `~/tools`, Docker images) · 6 spike-only dependencies approved (`livekit_client`, `flutter_zoom_videosdk`, `http`, `@zoom/videosdk`) · 7 Zoom web probe approved.
- Consequence of answer 2/3: iOS native builds (LiveKit and Zoom) wait for the Mac window; everything else proceeds. iPhone/iPad are measured in Safari first.

## Deviations / surprises
- Provider facts checked 2026-10-12 (sources in design.md §8): Zoom has no Flutter web plan; Zoom JWT `exp` must be ≥ 30 min after `iat`, which weakens "short-lived token" (CLS-03); LiveKit Cloud stores no recordings (egress needs our bucket); LiveKit EU media pinning needs the Scale plan; Zoom free tier is 20 credits (≈ 5,700 participant-minutes), not the 10,000 min/month quoted in spec/16.
- Least privilege in the spike: client tokens carry no `roomAdmin`; moderation goes through the spike server, which checks a server-signed admin ticket (teacher/substitute only).
